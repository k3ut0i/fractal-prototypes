* Fractal Images
Simple prototypes for generating fractal images. These might not be efficient ways for computing the required data.
** Mandelbrot
*** Simple representation of the set

*** Generating a better colored version

*** Generating the image in a specific vicinity

** Julia
Plotting a Julia set is quite complicated compared to it's Mandelbrot version. 

** Lindenmayer Systems

*** Binary trees
